\subsection{Selected requirements}
In this document we will focus on system changes needed to fulfil the follwing set of requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR1.} Subject owner shall be able to archive and unarchive the subject. Archived subject does not support adding, deleting or changing topics and uploaded conspectuses.
    \item \textbf{FR2.} System shall automatically archive subjects with no recent topic or conspectus changes after 1 month.
    \item \textbf{FR3.} Subject owner shall be notified about automatic archivation.
    \item \textbf{FR4.} Users and administrators shall be able to be notified via system notification and email.
    \item \textbf{FR5.} Administrator shall be able create other adminstrator accounts.
    \item \textbf{FR6.} Administrator creation and OpenAI limit setting actions shall be logged.
    \item \textbf{FR7.} Administrator shall be able to access OpenAI service usage statistics.
    \item \textbf{FR8.} Administrator shall be able to set OpenAI usage limits.
    \item \textbf{FR9.} System shall notify administrator if OpenAI usage exceeds limits.
    \item \textbf{FR10.} Users shall be able to leave feedback that administrators can access. Administrators shall be notified.
\end{itemize}

\section{Logical View}

\subsection{Informational model}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{../lab2diags/logical-view/informational.drawio.svg}
    \label{informational-model}
    \caption{Informational model}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
    \item[Subjects and topics] Subject is a primary organizational unit of the system. Subject is owned by user. Inside subjects there are topics. Last update timestamp is used by automatic archivation process and is updated whenever topics or conspectuses are updated or subject name is changed..
    \item[Conspectuses] Conspectuses are files stored in topics.
    \item[Accounts] System has 2 account types: user and administrator. User accounts are regular accounts used for interacting with the system and encapsulate student and teacher functionality. Administrator accounts are separate from user accounts and are only used for system administration.
    \item[Notifications] Notifications are sent to account and can be accessed in the UI (email message is sent as well). Subclasses are used to provide additional functionality, such as linking subject, so UI can display a button that redirects to subject page or offers a different set of controls.
    \item[ChatMessages] ChatMessages are stored for OpenAI chat.
    \item[AccountActions] System stores different types of account actions, currently only administrator related actions are stored but it may change in the future.
    \item[OpenAIStats] Object of this class is used by system to store token usage by day.
\end{description}

\subsection{Detailed subsystems}

\subsubsection{Data access classes}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{../lab2diags/logical-view/data-access.drawio.svg}
    \label{data-access-model}
    \caption{Data access diagram}
\end{figure}

EduPal uses Entity Framework Core ORM and PostgreSQL DBMS that impose certain restrictions on classes, instances of which need to be stored. Every class must have a primary key and it was decided to use Id string attribute. In order to abstract data access, repository pattern is used. Downside of such approach is that every class must extend BaseEntity class. In following model diagrams BaseEntity and Repository classes will be shown without attributes and methods. System settings are not stored in database, instead a json file is loaded when object is instantiated. SystemSettings class is injected as singleton. Usage of ASP.NET Identity allows all controllers to have access to account id from request context.

\subsubsection{Notification subsystem}

Other subsystems can send notifications via INotificationService interface. Its implementation is used to send email to account and send ping message using SignalR so that client can send request to get unread notifications. NotificationDto is used to send notifications to client and combines all subclasses into 1 class, client will use type attribute to determine what subclass to use.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{../lab2diags/logical-view/notification.drawio.svg}
    \label{notification-model}
    \caption{Notification subsystem diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Archivation subsystem}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=\textwidth]{../lab2diags/logical-view/archivation.drawio.svg}
    \caption{Archivation subsystem diagram}
    \label{archivation-model}
\end{figure}

System users can send archivation and unarchivation requests as well as access archived subjects. Updating archived subject would cause a fail. Automatic service is scheduled to perform automatic archivation every month and notify owner. Figure \ref{archivation-model} shows archivation subsystem diagram.

\subsubsection{Administration and feedback subsystem}

Figures \ref{administration-model} and \ref{feedback-model} shows administration and feedback subsystem diagrams. AccountController is capable of creating both administrator and regular users, process differs, as only administrator can create other administrator accounts.

\end{figure}

\begin{description}
    \item[Actors] User
    \item[Requirements] FR1, FR11
    \item[Description] User can request subject archivation or unarchivation. In both cases system must check whether user is the owner of a particular subject. If that is the case, subjcet archivation state is updated, otherwise nothing happens.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Automatic subject archivation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includesvg{../lab2diags/use-cases/automatic-archivation.drawio.svg}

\begin{description}
    \item[Actors] User, System clock
    \item[Requirements] FR2, FR3, FR11
    \item[Description] System clock regularly initates automatic archivation check process. All users who own subjects that were not updated in a specified amount of time will be notified about archivation. If they do not respond, their subject will be automatically archived.
\end{description}

\subsection{Administration}

\end{description}

\subsubsection{OpenAI usage control}

\begin{description}
    \item[Actors] Administrator
    \item[Requirements] FR5, FR6, FR7
    \item[Description] Administrator can view OpenAI usage (used tokens, price) and set limits. Action of setting limits is logged.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Notification on OpenAI usage}

\begin{description}
    \item[Actors] Administrator, User
    \item[Requirements] FR8
    \item[Description] Every time user uses OpenAI integration, system calculates usage and notifies administrator if it exceeds limits.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Feedback collection}

\begin{description}
    \item[Actors] Administrator, User
    \item[Requirements] FR9
    \item[Description] Users can leave feedback that administrators have access to.

\section{Physical View}

\subsection{Deployment Diagram}

The diagram below showcases how the deployed containers look like in the Azure Kubernetes Cluster.

    \label{deployment-showcase}
    \caption{Deployment showcase}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Resources}

\textbf{Providers:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure
    \item CI/CD Platform: Gitlab
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Plan/Tier:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Azure Student Tier: Azure offers free access to university students, providing a 100 credit for 12 months and access to over 25 free services. This is a good option for small scale applications and showing the deployment process
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Azure services:}
All Azure resources are created in the same resource group to simplify management and billing. Region used: East US.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Azure Kubernetes Service:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1 node pool.
            \item Standard B2s (2 vCPU, 4 GB memory) nodes.
            \item Autoscaling Enabled.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Azure PostgreSQL service: This is a managed PostgreSQL database service offered by Azure. The database is accessible 24/7 that allows for convenient access to the database.
    \item Azure Container Registry: This is a managed, private Docker registry service offered by Azure. It is used for React and ASP.NET docker image uploading to use in Helm Charts. Also, it contains a custom docker image for testing and building the application in CI stage.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Database Management System:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Azure SQL Database: This is a managed relational database service offered by Azure. It provides a familiar SQL experience with automatic scaling, high availability, and built-in security features.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Security Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure Coding Practices: Implement secure coding practices in both the React app and .NET backend to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    \item Secret Management: Store sensitive information in kubernetes secrets or Azure Key Vault to easily access stored secrets and prevent unauthorized access.
    \item Network Security Groups: Use NSGs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to your Azure resources, only allowing access from authorized sources.
    \item Azure Managed Identity: Kubernetes cluster is authenticated with Azure Managed Identity. That way CI pipeline's runner can have authorization to deploy to the cluster and pull images from ACR.
    \item Regular Updates: Keep your application code, libraries, and frameworks updated with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operating System:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linux Docker Images:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cost-Effective: Linux typically has lower licensing costs compared to Windows Server.
            \item Lightweight: Linux distributions are generally lightweight which can improve performance, especially for containerized deployments.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scaling Strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vertical Scaling: This involves upgrading the resources allocated to your existing Azure App Service instances (e.g., increasing CPU cores or memory). This can improve performance without adding additional instances.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment process}
