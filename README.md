# PSI 2 - Let's hope for the best

## Setup

Here's the supported setup:

1. Use VSCode
2. Install [LaTeX Workshop extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
3. Setup LaTeX (there are many ways to install, refer to [our template recommendations](https://github.com/LIKS/course_work_template_vu_mif_se))

## Working with LaTeX

- You don't work with LaTeX, you just write text and ask Google or Uncle GPT for some specific formatting help

- You write PlantUML directly in LaTeX

- Use LaTeX extension pdf preview feature to check the pdf. Pdf will be regenerated after save. It takes about 10 seconds, so I suggest only checking it when necessary.

- Final project can be built using `make` command.
