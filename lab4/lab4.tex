\section{Questions to ask}

\textbf{Context: what is missing?}

\textbf{Context viewpoint: what is missing?}

\textbf{Functional viewpoint: what is missing?}

\textbf{Information viewpoint: what is missing?}

Others context : system (database is in there), user. Text: system responsibilities. Description of external systems, what entities external system uses. Use cases from third lab.

Others functional: traceability between requirements and components.

Others Information: abstract than just database. (not tied to db or code), information access (who can access what and what are their permissions), information quality (what we store, what we don't store, how we filter data)

Concurrency view: system start, stop

Deployment view: deployment diagram, description, go through aspects that we must cover.

Perspectives after each viewpoint. Every perspective we selected must be covered, if its unrelated, then we write why its unrelated.

Ask about patterns and styles!

Ask if we should put OpenAI into context viewpoint.

Important!!! Reverse interface symbol in component diag.
