\section{Questions to ask}

\textbf{Context: what is missing?}

\textbf{Context viewpoint: what is missing?}

\textbf{Functional viewpoint: what is missing?}

\textbf{Information viewpoint: what is missing?}

Others context : system (database is in there), user. Text: system responsibilities. Description of external systems, what entities external system uses. Use cases from third lab.

Concurrency view: system start, stop

Deployment view: deployment diagram, description, go through aspects that we must cover.

Ask about patterns and styles!

Ask if we should put OpenAI into context viewpoint. No.
