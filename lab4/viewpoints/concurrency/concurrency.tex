\section{Concurrency viewpoint}

\subsection{Overview}

EduPal primary task is to handle requests by the interface layer. ASP.NET Core is used for efficient task processing - every request is handled asynchronously by the system using the thread pool managed by the ASP.NET Core.

Quiz sessions are handled differently - when new quiz session is created, the system initiates the session thread that is responsible for quiz session management and handling of SignalR connections and timing.

Since EduPal is a monolithic system, processes communicate via code interfaces.

\subsection{Quiz session state management}

Quiz session processing is one of the hardest part of the system. The following diagram displays quiz session state changes

\end{figure}

\subsection{Synchronization and Integrity}

The following things help EduPal to keep information uncorrupted:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Business and interface layer services must be stateless and not store any data.
  \item Data access layer is responsible for caching ensure that upper layers will not have differently cached data.
  \item There is only one thread per quiz session.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability support}

EduPal concurrency model is scalable but limited by a monolithic architecture. Still, vertical scaling of core count is possible as this allows more requests to be processed simultaneously.

\subsection{Startup and shutdown}

EduPal being a monolithic architecture makes startup and shutdown simple.

Startup:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Database migrations are applied
  \item EduPal monolithic backend is started
  \item React Page Server is started
\end{enumerate}

Shutdown:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item System stops allowing creation of new sessions.
  \item A 1 hour shutdown timer is started.
  \item Once time is out, system sends a message to all active quiz sessions about shutdown.
  \item Backend is stopped.
  \item FReact Page Server is stopped.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task failure}

In order to handle component failure, components cannot depend on processes of other components.

\subsection{Reentrancy}

Stateless process operation ensures reentrancy.
